System analysis and Design

DrivePass was built with one purpose in mind. To train students for their driving tests. This would allow soon-to-be drivers like my 16-year cousin to take online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training to better prepare for their driving tests. The owner of DrivePass; Liam saw an opportunity for new driver preparation. Many people fail their driving tests at the DMV, DrivePass is meant to the reduce rate of driving test failure, all while increasing overall skill for new drivers.
User Interface Requirements was my best area of success. I was able to identify the user experience from a UI point of view.
The system Description section was arguably the weak point of my document. It carried redundant or misplaced information. Such misplaced information (most of the bullet points in the system background section) would have been better if placed within the objectives of functional requirements.
I interpreted the userâ€™s needs and implemented them by separating the core functions by user type/access. Certain users used the system entirely differently than others. An example would be an IT admin who would need full access and the ability to manage other user accounts.
My approach to designing software will be very similar to what was done during this course. The key difference is in the real world the relevant information will not be ready as easily as in this assignment. We were provided a text document with a large amount of needed information. However, in a real scenario it will be more reliant on communication with the client and their personnel if they have any along with proper research on my end.
